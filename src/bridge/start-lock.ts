/**
 * Cross-window serialization for harness startup.
 *
 * On editor start VS Code restores every window, and every window runs its
 * own Start at the same moment. Without a lock they all see an empty pid
 * file, all run prepare (concurrent npm installs into one runtime tree corrupt
 * it), and all spawn: the last pid wins the file and the earlier harnesses
 * become orphans holding their ports. The lock exists so exactly one window
 * prepares and spawns while the others wait and then adopt.
 *
 * A lock is `start.lock` holding the holder's pid. Two steal rules, because
 * one is not enough: the holder's process is gone (instant steal), or the
 * lock is older than `staleMs` (steal a wedged holder). The mtime rule must
 * be generous: a cold prepare legitimately takes minutes (npm install over
 * the network, plugin add, --dump-config), and the holder never refreshes
 * the lock while it works, so the budget must exceed the worst real prepare
 * or a slow mirror gets its healthy holder's lock stolen. No `vscode`
 * import, and every wait is an option.
