/**
 * Loading the staged core's catalog surface (`resolveServedModels`, plus
 * `buildDisplayKeys` when present) behind one never-throwing, invalidatable
 * source.
 *
 * The extension and the node rails build the SAME source over the SAME file
 * (the profile-installed core at `profiles/vllmc/node_modules/vllm-copilot-core`,
 * where pnpm resolved the core's bare dependencies; the raw vendor staging has
 * no node_modules and dies on import). That is the point: a loader the rails
 * do not share is a loader the ship gate never exercises, and the served-catalog
 * path would again be proven only by fakes that echo their own assumptions.
 *
 * Duck-typed on purpose: staged cores older than 1.37.1 export neither name,
 * and a too-old core must degrade to "offer every model unfiltered", the same
 * posture as a probe that cannot reach the server. A load failure is a warning,
 * never a throw: prepare must survive a broken stage.
 *
 * `invalidate()` exists because the extension restages the core in place when
 * vLLM-Copilot updates, while Node's module cache would otherwise serve the
 * previous build's exports to the same window forever. The bump query is part
 * of the module cache key and nothing else: Node's file loader strips it
 * before touching disk.
