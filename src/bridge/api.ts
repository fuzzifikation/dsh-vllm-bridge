/**
 * The ledger handoff contract with vLLM-Copilot.
 *
 * The main extension owns the canonical usage ledger, so it also owns dedup
 * and resets: it is the only party that knows which `recordId`s it has already
 * folded in and when the user last cleared the totals. The bridge therefore
 * never writes `usage.json` itself (two writers on one cumulative blob is how
 * counters get double counted); it hands records over this interface and
 * deletes its copies only after the owner acknowledges them.
 *
 * `activate()` in vLLM-Copilot returns this object. When it returns nothing
 * (any build before the API existed) `asLedgerPort` yields undefined and the
 * bridge keeps its outbox and shows a reminder rather than inventing its own
 * ledger the dashboard cannot see.
