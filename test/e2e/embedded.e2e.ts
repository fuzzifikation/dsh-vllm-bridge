/**
 * Tripwire for a breakage that bit for real on 2026-10-05: the harness was
 * ruled to open embedded (an editor tab), and the extension quietly degraded
 * to the external browser. Two distinct failures hide behind that symptom and
 * only a real extension host can tell them apart:
 *  - `simpleBrowser.show` missing from the command registry (built-in dropped
 *    or disabled in this VS Code build), where the documented fallback fires;
 *  - the command existing but not producing a tab, e.g. an argument-shape
 *    drift on a built-in nobody owns.
 * The test drives the primitive, never `dshBridge.open`, so a fallback can
 * never fling a real browser at the desktop from inside CI.
